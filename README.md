## The Workshop - what we’ll cover 

1. Collective Libraries, collective librarianship - the big idea and supporting #bookcamping 
2. Using Zotero - building a library and reading room 
3. Beyond the Interface - using Zotero API to design custom interfaces 
4. Discussion and co-creation - ideas and steps for next rapid-prototype round 

## Summary 

In the workshop we will create a ‘reading room’ around a single topic to emulate one of the #bookcamping subject tours, for example ‘15M The Academy’ http://bookcamping.cc/LibroMadrid15MccBiblio/capitulo-6-el-15m-desde-la-academia 

Firstly there will be an entry level tutorial on how to use Zotero an open source bibliographic management software, that can accommodate any media, and allows for personal and collaborative research organisation and commentaries. In the workshop we will build an online library, a reading room and populating it with media.

Secondly, going beyond the Zotero interface. Understanding how Zotero can be used as a database and interfaced via its API to create Web library. We will use an example prototype Website and go through a survey of the ‘State of Zotero’ showing how others are hacking Zotero. 

Lastly, an introduction to the ‘big idea’ we have for Zotero’s use. Personally or as groups keeping a catalog of the media and notes in our daily lives is out of control, with an endless stream of services offering to help you get better organised. Zotero’s forte is interoperability, setting it apart from other solutions. We believe Zotero is a valuable tool for sharing expertise, allowing people to take on different roles to act as collective librarians. Through a series of rapid-prototyping, hack-event, we look to explore Zotero as an option to make this much needed ‘Next Step’ in P2P collective knowledge work. 

## Context 

The workshop is taking place as part of Hidden Histories, hosted by Medialab Prado, which will be screened on the digital façade Medialab Prado, Madrid, on September 11th 2015. The project is part of an ongoing cycle by the Hybrid Publishing Consortium of co-creation and rapid prototyping workshops to create open source infrastructures for archiving and publishing.
