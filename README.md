# Collaborative Bibliographies
An experimental project using the [Mute Magazine Print Archive](http://www.metamute.org/editorial/books/mute-magazine-print-archive) to look at archive remix-publishing, to accompany an [exhibition](https://www.facebook.com/events/187497858364325/) at Anagram Books, Berlin, Nov 2016.

The setup connects Zotero (a collaborative sources manager) to a real-time, live updating, website using GitHub (a code repository). In a nutshell, edit items in Zotero and the website gets refreshed.

The result is that we turn A into B.

A. Zotero B. Website

NB: This is a PROTOTYPE project, so expect glitches - they're features not bugs :-) Support requests, bugs, feature requests - please post to the [issues](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/issues) area on GitHub in the menu-tab above.

## Guides

See the **[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/blob/gh-pages/getting-started-guide.md)** for a step-by-step introductions.

**Fast Track** - if you want to get cracking then follow these steps, make a [Zotero account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/), join the [Mute Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute) and start editing items in the sub-folders of the [archive](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute/items/collectionKey/93KX44QJ) folder. Then refresh the [Collaborative Bibliographies](https://mute-publishing.github.io/archive/) website and your items are live.

## Prototype Idea

We want to explore what can be done with collaborative bibliographies in an open-web context and how this can be used to support the radical publishing community.

Mute in collaboration with the Hybrid Publishing Group is using the Mute Magazine Print Archive as a basis for the overall project.

Using the Zotero free and open source software as a basis we are looking at these example questsions;

+ Publication Remixing - trying out a different workflow production architecture for publication making. Putting aside the ususal process - idea, publisher, publication - and replacing it with - material, group, context = ?
+ Online Community Librarianship - creating expert content packages on a question or topic.
+ Road Testing Existing Tech Stack - looking at how existing modules can be bent to the projects ideas.

## Tech Stack
Not all of these parts have been employed and connected, but this is what is in mind.

The modules are used to create a combination of DIY archive setup, flat file architecture option, and collaborative bibliography/sources.

Where possible software is free and open source.

+ DIY Scanning - ScanTailor, ScanBot (Android App)
+ Image Deep Zooming and Deep Linking - IIIF and OpenLayers
+ File Storage - GitHub, GitHub LFS, BaseX
+ Transformation - Transpect, VivlioStyle
+ Editing, Workflow - Fidus Writer
+ Bibliography and Sources - Zotero
+ Website - GitHub Pages

## Exhibition and Events
The project has been kicked off by an residency at Anagram Books, Berlin, by Simon Worthington of Mute. See Facebook for details.

The residency takes place over ten days, with an opening on the 18th Nov. Over the residency period a series of collaborative bibliographies will be made on the topics of 'experimental writing' and 'financial crisis' from the contents of Mute's archive. This will result in an online and offline catalogue. On the 25th Nov a workshop to expore and discuss the ideas will take place over the afternoon.

It is anticipated that further events will follow at later dates.

## Acknowledgements
The project is a collaboration between Mute and the Hybrid Publishign Group, with support from Anagram Books.

The technical project is based on project lead by the Hybrid Publishing Group (HPG) for the BookCamping group at Media Lab Prado. HPG collaborated with Xm:lab to develop and produce the project and it was funded as part of the Connecting Cities curatorial programme 2015.

Special thanks goes to Loraine Furter who made the software to connect Zotero and GH Pages, as well as designing the interface.
