# Collaborative Bibliographies
The setup connects Zotero (a collaborative sources manager) to a real-time live updating website using GitHub (a code repository). In a nutshell edit items in Zotero and the website gets refreshed.

## Guides
The **fast track** is to make a [Zotero account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/)
, joing the [Mute Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute) and started editing items in the sub-folders of the [archive folder](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute/items/collectionKey/93KX44QJ). Then refresh the [Collaborative Bibliographies](https://mute-publishing.github.io/archive/) website and your items are live.

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/blob/gh-pages/getting-started-guide.md)

NB: This is a PROTOTYPE project, so expect glyches. Support requests, bugs, feature requests - please post to the [issues](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/issues) area on GitHub in the menu-tab above.
