# Collaborative Bibliographies
The setup connects Zotero (a collaborative sources manager) to a real-time, live updating, website using GitHub (a code repository). In a nutshell, edit items in Zotero and the website gets refreshed.

NB: This is a PROTOTYPE project, so expect glyches. Support requests, bugs, feature requests - please post to the [issues](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/issues) area on GitHub in the menu-tab above.

## Guides

**See the [Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/blob/gh-pages/getting-started-guide.md)** for a step-by-step introductions.

**Fast Track** - if you want to get cracking then follow these steps, make a [Zotero account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/)
, join the [Mute Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute) and start editing items in the sub-folders of the [archive](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute/items/collectionKey/93KX44QJ) folder. Then refresh the [Collaborative Bibliographies](https://mute-publishing.github.io/archive/) website and your items are live.
