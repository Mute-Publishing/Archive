# Collaborative Bibliographies
An experimental project using the [Mute Magazine Print Archive](http://www.metamute.org/editorial/books/mute-magazine-print-archive) to look at archive remix-publishing, to accompany an [exhibition](https://www.facebook.com/events/187497858364325/) at Anagram Books, Berlin, Nov 2016.

The setup connects Zotero (a collaborative sources manager) to a real-time, live updating, website using GitHub (a code repository). In a nutshell, edit items in Zotero and the website gets refreshed.

The result is that we turn A into B.

NB: This is a PROTOTYPE project, so expect glitches - they're features not bugs :-) Support requests, bugs, feature requests - please post to the [issues](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/issues) area on GitHub in the menu-tab above.

## Guides

See the **[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/Mute-Publishing/archive/blob/gh-pages/getting-started-guide.md)** for a step-by-step introductions.

**Fast Track** - if you want to get cracking then follow these steps, make a [Zotero account](https://www.zotero.org/user/register/), join the [Mute Group](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute) and start editing items in the sub-folders of the [archive](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute/items/collectionKey/93KX44QJ) folder. Then refresh the [Collaborative Bibliographies](https://mute-publishing.github.io/archive/) website and your items are live.

## Prototype Idea

We want to explore what can be done with collaborative bibliographies in an open-web context and how this can be used to support the radical publishing community.

Mute in collaboration with the Hybrid Publishing Group is using the Mute Magazine Print Archive as a basis for the overall project.

Using the Zotero free and open source software as a basis we are looking at these example questsions;

+ Publication Remixing - trying out a different workflow production architecture for publication making. Putting aside the ususal process - idea, publisher, publication - and replacing it with - material, group, context = ?
+ Online Community Librarianship - creating expert content packages on a question or topic.
+ Road Testing Existing Tech Stack - looking at how existing modules can be bent to the projects ideas.

## Tech Stack
Not all of these parts have been employed and connected, but this is what is in mind.

The modules are used to create a combination of DIY archive setup, flat file architecture option, and collaborative bibliography/sources.

Where possible software is free and open source.

+ DIY Scanning - ScanTailor, ScanBot (Android App)
+ Image Deep Zooming and Deep Linking - IIIF and OpenLayers
+ File Storage - GitHub, GitHub LFS, BaseX
+ Transformation - Transpect, VivlioStyle
+ Editing, Workflow - Fidus Writer
+ Bibliography and Sources - Zotero
+ Website - GitHub Pages
