In setting up Zotero we'll cover these items, all you need to set you on your way;
+ Adding a Mute magazine article
+ Adding a comment
+ Adding an external source, in this case a book but it could be anything

### A. Join the Mute Zotero Group

Groups on Zotero are collaborative 'bibliography and sources' catalogs. 

1. Go to the [Zotero website](https://www.zotero.org/) and register. You'll need to verify your account via email and then login.
2. On the Zotero website join the ['Mute group'](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute). Navigate to the 'Group Library' and you will see all the items in the group.

### B. Add a Mute magazine article

First find an article in the Mute Magazine Print Archive that you would like to add to the 'collaborative bibliography'. In this example we'll use the The Metamap. Have the articles webpage tab open in your browser.

Then navigate to the folder you want to add it to in the Group Library and select it, you wil see the items already in the folder.

The folders are arranges like so:

```
Archive/

Archive/Experimental Writing/

Archive/Financial Crisis/
```

Now you can add your article using the green button about the title field of the item list.  First you will be prompted to select its item type, in this case choose 'Magazine Artcle', then you will be presented with a list of items, fill them out as best you can and save.

To view youz new addition on the webite for the 'collaborative bibliography' load the site https://mute-publishing.github.io/archive and your item will be in the appropriate list. Since we added The Metamap to Experimental Writing we can see it listed there.

### C. Adding other sources; books, or anything else.
