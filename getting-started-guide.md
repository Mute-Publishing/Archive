In setting up Zotero we'll cover these items, all you need to set you on your way;
+ Adding a Mute magazine article
+ Adding a comment
+ Adding an external source, in this case a book but it could be anything

### A. Join the Mute Zotero Group

Groups on Zotero are collaborative 'bibliography and sources' catalogs. 

1. Go to the [Zotero website](https://www.zotero.org/) and register. You'll need to verify your account via email and then login.
2. On the Zotero website join the ['Mute group'](https://www.zotero.org/groups/mute). Navigate to the 'Group Library' and you will see all the items in the group.

### B. Add a Mute magazine article
